# Team Four Project - Bored!

## The Concept
Create a responsive website that uses two API's, uses local storage and does not use alerts.

Bored! is a random activity generator that uses the Bored API to provide random activities and tells you the weather to plan around your activity. It produces activities that are categorized by type, participants, price, and accessibility. Types include education, recreational, social, DIY, charity, cooking, relaxation, music and busywork. Participants range from 1 - 4 people. Price is on a scale from 1 â€“ 10 where 1 is free and 10 is pricy. Accessibility is on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0 describing how possible the event is to do with zero being the most accessible. Click on the button and an activity is generated.
